# HR-Analytics
In this project i used the following libraries:numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics, seaborn.
I actually chose this project because it was about data scientists and that is what i want to become one day, I wanted to see what it takes to be able to get a job for it and looking at this data and analyzing in game the chance to do so.
So at first i started by cleaning up the data checking for null values and i found a lot of them so i got rid of them and after that i started visulizing it i checked for the relationship between gender and education_level and i found out that most of the males had more education than females then i checked for the relationship between enrolled_university and relevent_experience and i found out that most of them has experience in the field so who isn't enrolled in university has more experience and then i went to making some predictions so i used city_development_index and enrollee_id trying to predict training_hours and here i used linear regression but i got a bad result so i went to using other variables trying to predict education_level but first i had to make some changes to the used data butat the end i got an even worst result.
